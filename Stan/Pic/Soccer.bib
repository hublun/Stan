abstract = {Summary. Models based on the bivariate Poisson distribution are used for modelling sports data. Independent Poisson distributions are usually adopted to model the number of goals of two competing teams. We replace the independence assumption by considering a bivariate Poisson model and its extensions. The models proposed allow for correlation between the two scores, which is a plausible assumption in sports with two opposing teams competing against each other. The effect of introducing even slight correlation is discussed. Using just a bivariate Poisson distribution can improve model fit and prediction of the number of draws in football games. The model is extended by considering an inflation factor for diagonal terms in the bivariate joint distribution. This inflation improves in precision the estimation of draws and, at the same time, allows for overdispersed, relative to the simple Poisson distribution, marginal distributions. The properties of the models proposed as well as interpretation and estimation procedures are provided. An illustration of the models is presented by using data sets from football and water-polo.},

    abstract = { The problem of modelling football data has become increasingly popular in the last few years and many different models have been proposed with the aim of estimating the characteristics that bring a team to lose or win a game, or to predict the score of a particular match. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to fulfil both these aims and test its predictive strength based on data about the Italian Serie A 1991–1992 championship. To overcome the issue of overshrinkage produced by the Bayesian hierarchical model, we specify a more complex mixture model that results in a better fit to the observed data. We test its performance using an example of the Italian Serie A 2007–2008 championship. }

Using NHL regular-season data from 2005–2010, we identify four forward types, four defensemen types, and three goalie types. Goalies tend to contribute the most to team performance, followed by forwards and then defensemen. We also show that once we account for salary cap and playing-time information, the value of different player types may become similar. Lastly, we illustrate how to use the regression results to analyze trades and their impact on team performance. },

  abstract = { The difference in difference (DID) design is a quasi-experimental research design that researchers often use to study causal relationships in public health settings where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are infeasible or unethical. However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method’s assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health Volume 39 is April 1, 2018. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates. },

  abstract  = {This study aimed to examine the influence of level of competition (amateur, semi-professional and professional) on the magnitude of home advantage (HA) in Portuguese football, and to verify whether the HA has changed over time. Archival data from 32,400 matches contested in the three levels of competition over 11 seasons (from 2005/2006 to 2015/2016) were analysed. HA was quantified each season for each league as the number of points won at home expressed as a percentage of all points won at home and away. The mean values of HA were significantly greater than 50% in all levels of Portuguese football (p < .001). One-way repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of competitive level on HA (p < .05). In the professional league, the HA was significantly lower (58.31%) than in amateur and semi-professional competitive levels (60.36 and 60.46%, respectively). Altogether, a declining HA effect was found in Portuguese football in recent years. However, negative linear relationships between HA and time were only significant at amateur and semi-professional levels (p < .05), while the decline in the major professional league has already started to level off. These findings demonstrate that the advantage of playing at home is losing importance in Portugal. The declining effect of HA, previously evidenced in major professional leagues, has been mirrored by a similar decline at amateur and semi-professional levels within the country. Future research should confirm whether the trends identified in Portugal are also verified in football leagues of other countries.},

  abstract  = {An analysis is made of home advantage in the group stages of qualification for the 2006, 2010 and 2014 football World Cup finals, the first such study of national teams worldwide in a competitive setting. Home advantage was greatest in Africa and South America where the home team won just over 69% of all points earned; it was lowest in Europe (56%). Bolivia was the country with the greatest home advantage. Using each of the 2040 games as the observational units, a general linear model produced a significant fit to the data (R2 = 0.326), home points being the dependent variable, with a set of factors believed to influence home advantage as predictor variables. After controlling for team strength and allowing for the effects of other variables in the model, home points were significantly related to altitude of the home stadium, crowd size and number of time zones crossed by the visiting team (all p < 0.05). There was no significant effect for distance travelled by the away team, the existence of a running track or crowd density. Referees, especially in Africa, issued red cards and awarded penalties against the away team significantly more often than against the home team.

Data were examined using the autocorrelation function and linear regression analysis. Ball possession (p < .01), successful passes (p < .05), short passes (p < .01) and touches (p < .01) achieved their greatest values in the 0–5 min period compared with other match periods. However, as the first half went on, the home teams exhibited lower performances compared with those shown at the beginning of the match. This was particularly evident from the 16–20 min period until the end of the first half. This transient effect was enhanced or attenuated, depending on the quality of the opponent (p < .01). The better the opponent the lower the home teams’ performances at the beginning of the match. These variables can be used to develop a model to simulate team performance of home and away teams during the first half of a match.

  abstract  = {The home advantage is a widely acknowledged sporting phenomenon, especially in association football. Here, we examine the second leg home advantage, an effect that is discussed in the public domain but which has received very little scientific attention. The second leg home advantage effect occurs when on average teams are more likely to win a two-stage knock-out competition when they play at home in the second leg. That is, both teams have a home advantage but this advantage is significantly greater for the team that plays at home second. Examining data from three different European Cup football competitions spanning 51 years, we show that the second leg home advantage is a real phenomenon. The second leg home team has more than a 50% probability to qualify for the next round in the competition even after controlling for extra time and team ability as possible alternative explanations. The second leg home advantage appears, however, to have decreased significantly over the past decade. Possible reasons for its existence and subsequent decline are presented.

  abstract  = {Home advantage is well documented in a wide range of team sports including association football (soccer). Home team crowd support has been shown to be a likely causal factor and its influence on referee decision-making appears to play a significant role. Match data from the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League and Europa League were used to investigate referee bias in terms of the association between match location (home vs. away) and disciplinary sanctions used by football referees. The adjusted mean number of yellow cards received by home and away teams and the ratios of these means were estimated from Poisson regression models. After controlling for within-match measures of attacking dominance referees in the Champions League and Europa League issued 25% (p<0.001) and 10% (p=0.002) more yellow cards, respectively, to away teams than to home teams. The higher level of home team bias in the Champions League appeared to be mainly due to higher crowd densities. In a combined analysis of both UEFA leagues the magnitude of referee bias increased with increasing crowd density (p<0.001). Crowd size and crowd proximity were not associated with referee bias after controlling for crowd density. These results provide further evidence that crowd support influences referee decisions. Failure to control for within-match team performance may over-estimate the extent of referee bias in terms of the number of disciplinary sanctions used.

There is a shortage of research on the psychological states of actors involved. In this study, we examined soccer coaches’ expectations, goal setting and tactical decisions in relation to game location. Soccer coaches (N = 297) with different expertise levels participated in an experimental, online management game and were randomly assigned to one of two groups, “home game (HG)” or “away game.” Participants received information on the game for which they were asked to make decisions in multiple points. The only differing information between groups was game location. Regardless of expertise, HG coaches had higher expectations to win, set more challenging goals and decided for more offensive and courageous playing tactics. Possible consequences of these findings concerning home advantage in soccer are discussed.},

  abstract = {Throughout the different phases of a drug development program, randomized trials are used to establish the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a candidate drug. At each stage one aims to optimize the design of future studies by extrapolation from the available evidence at the time. This includes collected trial data and relevant external data. However, relevant external data are typically available as averages only, for example from trials on alternative treatments reported in the literature. Here we report on such an example from a drug development for wet age-related macular degeneration. This disease is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly population. While current treatment options are efficacious, they are also a substantial burden for the patient. Hence, new treatments are under development which need to be compared against existing treatments. The general statistical problem this leads to is meta-analysis, which addresses the question of how we can combine datasets collected under different conditions. Bayesian methods have long been used to achieve partial pooling. Here we consider the challenge when the model of interest is complex (hierarchical and nonlinear) and one dataset is given as raw data while the second dataset is given as averages only. In such a situation, common meta-analytic methods can only be applied when the model is sufficiently simple for analytic approaches. When the model is too complex, for example nonlinear, an analytic approach is not possible. We provide a Bayesian solution by using simulation to approximately reconstruct the likelihood of the external summary and allowing the parameters in the model to vary under the different conditions. We first evaluate our approach using fake-data simulations and then report results for the drug development program that motivated this research. (Less)},

The evidence shows that the appearance of stars increases home and road game attendance. A positive star externality on game attendance is found. },

While the ASA Statement notes that statistical significance and p-values are “commonly misused and misinterpreted,” it does not discuss and document broader implications of these errors for the interpretation of evidence. In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance. We discuss implications and offer recommendations.

However, the classical methods and most commercial software in this area are based on the covariance structure approach, which would encounter serious difficulties when dealing with complicated models and/or data structures. In contrast, the Bayesian approach has much more flexibility in handling complex situations. We give a brief introduction to SEMs and a detailed description of how to apply the Bayesian approach to this kind of model. Advantages of the Bayesian approach are discussed, and results obtained from a simulation study are provided for illustration. The intended audience is statisticians/methodologists who either know about SEMs or simple Bayesian statistics, and Ph.D. students in statistics, psychometrics, or mathematical psychology.},

The utility is chosen to represent the aim of the experiment and its expectation is taken with respect to all unknowns: responses, parameters and/or models. Although straightforward in principle, there are several challenges to finding Bayesian designs in practice. Firstly, the expected utility is rarely available in closed form and requires approximation. Secondly, the expected utility needs to be maximised over a, potentially, high-dimensional design space. In the case of intractable likelihood models, these problems are compounded by the fact that the likelihood function, whose evaluation is required to approximate the expected utility, is not available in closed form. A strategy is proposed to find Bayesian designs for intractable likelihood models. It relies on the development of new methodology involving auxiliary modelling to approximate the expected utility, under an intractable likelihood model, applied with the latest approaches to maximising approximated expected utilities.},

This avoids disregarding fair information, and does not require an often intractable computation of the path-specific effect. We leverage recent developments in deep learning and approximate inference to achieve a solution that is widely applicable to complex, non-linear scenarios.},

  title     = {Handling Multiplicity in Neuroimaging through Bayesian Lenses with Multilevel Modeling},
  journal   = {bioRxiv preprint},
  year      = {2017},
  month     = {dec},
  abstract  = {In neuroimaging, the multiplicity issue may sneak into data analysis through several channels, affecting
expected false positive rates (FPRs; type I errors) in diverse ways. One widely recognized aspect of multiplicity,
multiple testing, occurs when the investigator fits a separate model for each voxel in the brain. However,
multiplicity also occurs when the investigator conducts multiple comparisons within a model, tests two tails of
a t-test separately when prior information is unavailable about the directionality, and branches in the analytic
pipelines. The current practice of handling multiple testing through controlling the overall FPR in neuroimaging
under the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm excessively penalizes the statistical power with
inflated type II errors. More fundamentally, the adoption of dichotomous decisions through sharp thresholding
under NHST may not be appropriate when the null hypothesis itself is not pragmatically relevant because the
effect of interest takes a continuum instead of discrete values and is not expected to be null in most brain regions.
When the noise inundates the signal, two different types of error are more relevant than the concept of FPR:
incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M).
In light of these considerations, we introduce a different strategy using Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM)
to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency via one integrative (instead of many separate) model and
dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional NHST on FPR into quality control
by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency. The performance and
validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all
the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged
simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BHM may
simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency. The benefits of BHM are illustrated in
model performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. In addition, BHM offers an alternative,
confirmatory, or complementary approach to the conventional whole brain analysis under NHST, and promotes
results reporting in totality and transparency. The methodology also avoids sharp and arbitrary thresholding in
the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The modeling approach with its auxiliary
tools will be available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

  abstract  = {Missing data are common in clinical trials and could lead to biased estimation of treatment effects. The National Research Council (NRC) report suggests that sensitivity analysis on missing data mechanism should be a mandatory component of the primary reporting of findings from clinical trials, and regulatory agencies are requesting more thorough sensitivity analyses from sponsors. However, recent literature research showed that missing data were almost always inadequately handled. This is partially due to the lack of standard software packages and straightforward implementation platform. With recent availability of flexible Bayesian software packages such as WinBUGS, SAS Proc MCMC, and Stan, it is relatively simple to develop Bayesian methods to address complex missing data problems while incorporating the uncertainty. In this article, we present a case study from the DIA Bayesian Scientific Working Group (BSWG) on Bayesian approaches for missing data analysis. We illustrate how to use Bayesian approaches to fit a few commonly used frequentist missing data models. The properties, advantage, and flexibility of the Bayesian analysis methods will be discussed using a case study based on a schizophrenia clinical trial. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

  abstract = {The brms package implements Bayesian multilevel models in R using the probabilistic
programming language Stan. A wide range of distributions and link functions are
supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson,
survival, response times, ordinal, quantile, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear
models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of
the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as metaanalytic
standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users
to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can
easily be assessed and compared using posterior-predictive checks and leave-one-out crossvalidation.

  abstract  = {Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature. This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference and stochastic optimization of deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space. By doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks -- including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression -- and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.},

We provide an overview of each method and show that a salient difference is the choice of models. The two approaches as commonly practiced can be unified with a certain model specification, now popular in the statistics literature, called spike-and-slab priors. A spike-and-slab prior is a mixture of a null model, the spike, with an effect model, the slab. The estimate of the effect size here is a function of the Bayes factor, showing that estimation and model comparison can be unified. The salient difference is that common Bayes factor approaches provide for privileged consideration of theoretically useful parameter values, such as the value corresponding to the null hypothesis, while estimation approaches do not. Both approaches, either privileging the null or not, are useful depending on the goals of the analyst.},

  abstract = {The development of cognitive models involves the creative scientific formalization of assumptions, based on theory, observation, and other relevant information. In the Bayesian approach to implementing, testing, and using cognitive models, assumptions can influence both the likelihood function of the model, usually corresponding to assumptions about psychological processes, and the prior distribution over model parameters, usually corresponding to assumptions about the psychological variables that influence those processes. The specification of the prior is unique to the Bayesian context, but often raises concerns that lead to the use of vague or non-informative priors in cognitive modeling. Sometimes the concerns stem from philosophical objections, but more often practical difficulties with how priors should be determined are the stumbling block. We survey several sources of information that can help to specify priors for cognitive models, discuss some of the methods by which this information can be formalized in a prior distribution, and identify a number of benefits of including informative priors in cognitive modeling. Our discussion is based on three illustrative cognitive models, involving memory retention, categorization, and decision making.},

  abstract  = {This article provides a review of Bayesian model averaging as a means of optimizing the predictive performance of common statistical models applied to large-scale educational assessments. The Bayesian framework recognizes that in addition to parameter uncertainty, there is uncertainty in the choice of models themselves. A Bayesian approach to addressing the problem of model uncertainty is the method of Bayesian model averaging. Bayesian model averaging searches the space of possible models for a set of submodels that satisfy certain scientific principles and then averages the coefficients across these submodels weighted by each model’s posterior model probability (PMP). Using the weighted coefficients for prediction has been shown to yield optimal predictive performance according to certain scoring rules. We demonstrate the utility of Bayesian model averaging for prediction in education research with three examples: Bayesian regression analysis, Bayesian logistic regression, and a recently developed approach for Bayesian structural equation modeling. In each case, the model-averaged estimates are shown to yield better prediction of the outcome of interest than any submodel based on predictive coverage and the log-score rule. Implications for the design of large-scale assessments when the goal is optimal prediction in a policy context are discussed.

  title       = {Bayesian model assessment: Use of conditional vs marginal likelihoods},
  abstract    = {Typical Bayesian methods for models with latent variables (or random effects) involve directly sampling the latent variables along with the model parameters. In high-level software code for model definitions (using, e.g., BUGS, JAGS, Stan), the likelihood is therefore specified as conditional on the latent variables. This can lead researchers to perform model comparisons via conditional likelihoods, where the latent variables are considered model parameters. In other settings, typical model comparisons involve marginal likelihoods where the latent variables are integrated out. This distinction is often overlooked despite the fact that it can have a large impact on the comparisons of interest. In this paper, we clarify and illustrate these issues, focusing on the comparison of conditional and marginal Deviance Information Criteria (DICs) and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAICs) in psychometric modeling. The conditional/marginal distinction corresponds to whether the model should be predictive for the clusters that are in the data or for new clusters (where "clusters" typically correspond to higher-level units like people or schools). Correspondingly, we show that marginal WAIC corresponds to leave-one-cluster out (LOcO) cross-validation, whereas conditional WAIC corresponds to leave-one-unit (LOuO). These results lead to recommendations on the general application of these criteria to models with latent variables.},

  abstract    = {Tasks such as social network analysis, human behavior recognition, or modeling biochemical reactions, can be solved elegantly by using the probabilistic inference framework. However, standard probabilistic inference algorithms work at a propositional level, and thus cannot capture the symmetries and redundancies that are present in these tasks. Algorithms that exploit those symmetries have been devised in different research fields, for example by the lifted inference-, multiple object tracking-, and modeling and simulation-communities. The common idea, that we call state space abstraction, is to perform inference over compact representations of sets of symmetric states. Although they are concerned with a similar topic, the relationship between these approaches has not been investigated systematically. This survey provides the following contributions. We perform a systematic literature review to outline the state of the art in probabilistic inference methods exploiting symmetries. From an initial set of more than 4,000 papers, we identify 116 relevant papers. Furthermore, we provide new high-level categories that classify the approaches, based on the problem classes the different approaches can solve. Researchers from different fields that are confronted with a state space explosion problem in a probabilistic system can use this classification to identify possible solutions. Finally, based on this conceptualization, we identify potentials for future research, as some relevant application domains are not addressed by current approaches.},

This procedure not only identifies inaccurate computation and inconsistencies in model implementations but also provides graphical summaries that can indicate the nature of the problems that arise.

  month     = {apr},
  abstract  = {In systems biology, nonhomogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks (NH‐DBNs) have become a popular modeling tool for reconstructing cellular regulatory networks from postgenomic data. In this paper, we focus our attention on NH‐DBNs that are based on Bayesian piecewise linear regression models. The new NH‐DBN model, proposed here, is a generalization of an earlier proposed model with sequentially coupled network interaction parameters. Unlike the original model, our novel model possesses segment‐specific coupling parameters, so that the coupling strengths between parameters can vary over time. Thereby, to avoid model overflexibility and to allow for some information exchange among time segments, we globally couple the segment‐specific coupling (strength) parameters by a hyperprior. Our empirical results on synthetic and on real biological network data show that the new model yields better network reconstruction accuracies than the original model.},
